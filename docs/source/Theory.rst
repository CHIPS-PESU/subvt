The Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor is a type of insulated-gate field-effect transistor that is fabricated by the controlled oxidation
of a semiconductor, typically silicon. A MOSFET can be described as a voltage-controlled current source in electrical terms, here it operates as a switch
to conduct electricity in charging and discharging circuits.

The voltage of the covered gate determines the electrical conductivity of the device; this ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage
is used for switching electronic signals. The base material for MOSFETs is the semiconductor silicon (Si) which is a member of Group IV in the periodic table
of elements. With its four valence electrons, Si can form strong covalent Si-Si bonds with four surrounding Si atoms, leading to the formation of a
3-dimensional monocrystal structure. Si, as a substrate or wafer, has a lot of advantages due to the small mass, good thermal conductivity, the low cost,
and is widely used in microchip production because of these features. The conductivity of a pure Si crystal is very low since all of the four valence electrons
are required to form the bonds. To improve the conductivity of the Si crystal impurities, called dopants, are introduced into the crystal structure which
replaces Si atoms inside the crystal grid.

After the formation of four covalent bonds with the surrounding Si atoms, dopants from Group V of the periodic table of elements (e.g. Phosphorus, Arsenic)
have one excess electron left that can act as a free charge carrier inside the grid. Since this results in a net negative charge, it is called an n-type
semiconductor. If the silicon is doped with elements from Group III (e.g. Boron), i.e. with only three valence electrons, the dopant borrows an electron from
one of its neighbors creating a positively charged hole. This hole can propagate through the crystal, similar to free electrons, leading also to conductivity.
This is called a p-type semiconductor.
