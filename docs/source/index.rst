Welcome to Sub-Threshold Standard Cell Design's documentation!
==============================================================

In the present era of high-density and high-speed nanoelectronics, power consumption has been one of the most concerning factors.  Hence there is a rapidly growing demand for ultra-low power devices and advanced energy-saving methods for digital integrated circuits. The need for low-power circuits has up to now been limited to a small number of products, but this situation has changed drastically in the last few years, primarily because of the growing need for portability in computing and telecommunication products.

This documentation contains the tool flow for designing Sub-Threshold Standard Cells and all the results obtained so far.
