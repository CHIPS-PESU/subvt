Abstract
--------

In the present era of high-density and high-speed nanoelectronics, energy consumption has been one of the most concerning factors. Hence there is a
rapidly growing demand for ultra-low power devices and advanced energy-saving methods for digital integrated circuits primarily because of the growing
need for portability in computing and telecommunication products. We design standard cells to be used in a semi-custom ASIC Design flow. We further reduce
the energy consumption of UMC's commercial 28nm High-Performance Compact CMOS Process Technology by down-scaling the supply voltage. We automate significant
parts of the logic gate design process, enabling the rapid adoption of new processes or alternative designs.
